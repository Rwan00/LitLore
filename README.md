# LitLore 📚✨

**LitLore** is not just another book app — it’s a carefully crafted reading experience that combines functionality, fun, and a touch of personality.  

## Features & Challenges

### 1. Sign in with Google (OAuth 2.0)
- Users can log in seamlessly with their Google account.  
- **Challenge:** Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely with proper token handling (access tokens, refresh tokens, and scopes) to sync users’ Google Books library without compromising security.  
- **Result:** Your Google Books library becomes part of LitLore, ready to explore from the first tap.

### 2. Email & Password Login with Auto Google Linking
- Users can also log in with email/password.  
- **Challenge:** Automatically linking these accounts to the user’s Google account to fetch their existing library — ensuring a smooth and unified experience without manual steps.  
- **Result:** Users instantly get access to their entire library regardless of login method.

### 3. Fun Animations & Interactive UI
- Added animations to make the app lively and engaging.  
- **Challenge:** Balancing smooth performance with visually appealing transitions that don’t lag or disrupt the user experience.  
- **Result:** The app feels alive and welcoming, not just functional.

### 4. Customized Error Messages
- Traditional “No results found” messages? Too boring.  
- **Challenge:** Creating witty, playful error messages that communicate issues clearly while keeping the user smiling.  
- **Example:** Instead of “No results found,” the app might say, *“Are you sure you typed that right? 😏”*

### 5. Pagination in Search
- Efficiently loads book search results page by page.  
- **Challenge:** Handling API responses and integrating pagination smoothly without flickering, glitches, or crashes.  
- **Result:** Users can browse large libraries effortlessly, without performance hiccups.

### 6. Guided Tour with Mr. Flobby 🦉
- A fully interactive tour led by the app’s main character — Mr. Flobby the Owl.  
- **Challenge:** Designing a tour that’s informative, fun, and responsive, guiding users through every feature without feeling intrusive.  
- **Result:** A whimsical, engaging onboarding experience that makes users feel at home.
